# **CDUProject**

## _When making a suggestion to this mod, please ensure that;_  
1. You are using or checked the [recipes](https://github.com/TheBytro/CMRecipes/tree/master/src/main/resources/data/cmrecipes/recipes) of the latest version of CMRecipes.  
  This ensures that whatever suggestion you are going to make has not already been implemented
2. Give as much detail as to the way your suggestion works.(it is essential that you provide the mod name for the recipe and the item itself.  
3. Check to see if anyone else has posted on the same mod and item as you before making a request. Seeing multiple of the same request doesn't make me want to work on it, if anything I will purposely ignore it.

## _Your Structure Should be as follows_
MOD NAME: "Ex. Botania"```simply make the title the mod name```  
ITEM NAME: "Ex. Mana Lens"```limit it to one item per request``` 
  
By following this structure you make it easier for me to quickly go through a mod and tweak the recipe.
